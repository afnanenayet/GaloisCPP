        <p>This C++ library provides classes and operators for arithmetic operations on general finite field elements. A <em>field</em> is an algebraic structure in which the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by zero) can be performed, and satisfy the familiar rules of closure, commutativity, associativity and distributivity.</p>

<p>A <em>finite field</em> is a field containing a finite number of elements. The order of a finite field is the number of elements in the field. There exists a finite field F of order q if and only if q is a prime power, i.e., q = p^m, where p is a prime number, and m is a positive integer. The prime p is called the characteristic and m is called the dimension of the field. When m=1,  F is called a prime field, denoted GF(p). If m&gt;1 , then F is called an extension field, denoted GF(p^m). The most widely used finite fields are those with characteristic 2, also called the binary finite fields GF(2^m). However, there are applications that benefit from the use of general finite fields GF(p^m).</p>

<p>Finite field theory (aka Galois theory in honor of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Ã‰variste Galois</a></em>) is part of the discipline of abstract algebra, and has found interesting applications in cryptography and error-control coding.  Galois was a brilliant French mathematician who lived in the 18th century and made some great contributions to algebra before dying at the age of 20!</p>

<p>This C++ library aims at providing classes and overloaded operators for arithmetic operations on elements of general finite fields GF(p^m). Arithmetic in a finite field is different from standard integer arithmetic. Therefore the usual arithmetic operators have to be redefined/overloaded in C++. While there are software packages in C, C++ and other languages for the binary finite fields, the library presented here handles the general case, i.e., GF(p^m). In this library, the characteristic p of the finite field is a class parameter that can be set to any prime integer limited only by the computer's integer word. To promote maximum portability, this library is written in standard C++.</p>
